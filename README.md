Incorporates Voltmeter from this circuit and program *You will have to manually calibrate for your board and resistor combination*:  
[Easy Voltmeter with ESP8266](https://www.hackster.io/yettiz/easy-voltmeter-with-esp8266-mini-d1-pro-with-oled-display-1a91dc) The ideal charging voltage for a Standard 12V car battery is approximately 13.65Volts at the battery when it is on charge all the time up to 13.8Volts if it must charge faster and stay on. Too low it will not charge too high it reduces the life of the battery.

These solar power kits can have additional solar panels. [Solar Panel Kit](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/354249658561?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=705-154756-20017-0&ssspo=-g7m1pidt5g&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY)
